intro_text: |
    I'm a general nerd and this has a lot to do with my career as a system administrator, devops and backend developer. I want to provide the best service to clients. I'm loyal to principles and colleagues. I love standards and strive in an environment where we can establish them together. I contribute to open source. French and Python are my mother tongues. I was a DevOps before it was cool.
