## Who am I?

I'm often called a jack of all trades but I am mostly focusing on devops, system administration and backend development. I want to provide the best service to clients. I'm loyal to principles and colleagues. I love standards and strive in an environment where we can establish them together. I contribute to open source. French and Python are my mother tongues. I was a DevOps before it was cool. My ideal job is a well-balanced mix between software and solutions architecture, devops industrialization and tech leadership for other developers and devops.
